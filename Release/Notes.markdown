# Screenshots

We typically need to update the screenshots that are included in the App Store when releasing a new version of the app. We do this to accurately represent the current app UI and highlight new features. Three categories of screenshots are needed: iPhone 5.8", iPhone 5.5", and iPad 12.9".

## Steps

1. Update your Simulator's status bar with [SimulatorStatusMagic](https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SimulatorStatusMagic).
2. Make screenshots on three Simulator sizes: iPhone Plus, iPhone X, iPad 12.9".
3. Upload screenshots to [Shotbot](https://app.shotbot.io/#/edit/a69c6d60-5a1e-44ac-bfea-b29f62ee3d54) -- ask Aaron for the creds if you need them.
4. Update the app frame text with the verbiage specified in each Simulator size section.
5. Download screenshots.
6. Upload screenshots to iTunes Connect.
